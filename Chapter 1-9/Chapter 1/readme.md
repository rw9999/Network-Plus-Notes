# Introduction to Networks

### What is a Network?

The dictionary defines the word network as “a group or system of interconnected people or things.” 

Similarly, in the computer world, the term network means two or more connected computers that can share resources such as data and applications, office machines, an Internet connection, or some combination of these.

A really basic network made up of only two host computers connected; they share resources such as files and even a printer hooked up to one of the hosts.

These two hosts “talk” to each other using a computer language called **binary code**, which consists of lots of 1s and 0s in a specific order that describes exactly what they want to “say.”

### Local Area Network

Just as the name implies, a local area network (LAN) is usually restricted to spanning a particular geographic location such as an office building, a single department within a corporate office, or even a home office.

Back in the day, you couldn’t put more than 30 workstations on a LAN, and you had to cope with strict limitations on how far those machines could actually be from each other.

Because of technological advances, all that’s changed now, and we’re not nearly as restricted in regard to both a LAN’s size and the distance a LAN can span. 

Even so, it’s still best to split a big LAN into smaller logical zones known as **workgroups** to make administration easier.

The meaning of the term workgroup in this context is slightly different than when the term is used in contrast to domains. In that context, a workgroup is a set of devices with no security association with one another (whereas in a domain they do have that association). In this context, we simply mean they physically are in the same network segment.

In a typical business environment, it’s a good idea to arrange your LAN’s workgroups along department divisions; for instance, you would create a workgroup for Accounting, another one for Sales, and maybe another for Marketing.
